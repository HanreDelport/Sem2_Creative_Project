This is a small project that I had to submit for my CMPG121 module (where we did intro to c++) at the NWU.
The main focus of the project was to show understanding of the programming basics we learned and to implement OOP which we had to research on our own. I included the instructions we were given, so you can understand my task better.
In my "Phase 1" I  did most of the documentation, read those documents for better context
